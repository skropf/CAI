# Contributing

We welcome everyone to contribute and help us tackle existing issues. To do so, there are a few things you need to know about the code: The Facebook Messenger Bot example is aimed at people that are new to programming, and as such should focus on being very explicit and using non-clever code. Keep the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) in mind.

We usually keep a list of enhancements and bugs in the issue tracker. For proposing new features, please start a discussion in the issue tracker, preferably with a real-world example showing the advantage of what you are proposing. Please explain why a feature or change is useful and how it will impact the codebase and the community. Finally, remember all interactions in our official spaces follow our [Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org).

Use [parinfer](https://github.com/shaunlebron/parinfer) and follow the [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide).

The above contribution guidelines are inspired by the [Elixir contributing guidelines](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir#contributing).

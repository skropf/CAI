# CAI FBot (Conversational Audio Interface Facebook Bot)

Still in heavy development!

### What works
	For now speech-to-text conversion works via Google Speech API (see https://cloud.google.com/speech/reference/rest/v1/speech/recognize). Some standard replies/functions are still in codebase from https://github.com/lemmings-io/02-facebook-example.

### Goals
	- Bot with which you can converse via audio/text.
	- Answers any kind of question (integration of Google Assistant via gRPC).
